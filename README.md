# Hi there! 
Claudia here, tuning in from Spain 🇪🇸
I write about behavioral science and policy analysis, turning complex ideas into clear, engaging stories that anyone can learn from and use 🧠✨

In my free time, I build side projects that pop into my head—small tools and experiments designed to make everyday life a bit easier and smarter 🛠️💡
If you’re curious about behavior, public policy, or just love exchanging ideas, let’s connect and share knowledge! 🤝📚

Fun facts:

- 🤝 I spend part of my free time doing volunteer work 
- 📣 I work part‑time as a social media content creator, turning complex ideas into clear, visual stories.  
- 🎮 I love building small experimental projects and games to make learning and everyday decisions easier and more fun.  
- ☕ Most of my best ideas appear after a strong black coffee and a long walk.
